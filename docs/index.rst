About Qiskit Experiments
========================

Qiskit Experiments provides both a :doc:`library <apidocs/library>` of standard
quantum characterization, calibration, and verification experiments, and a
general :doc:`framework <apidocs/framework>` for implementing custom experiments
which can be run on quantum devices through Qiskit.

Experiments run on `IBMQ Provider <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider>`_
backends can be stored and retrieved from an online experiment
:doc:`database <apidocs/database_service>`.
