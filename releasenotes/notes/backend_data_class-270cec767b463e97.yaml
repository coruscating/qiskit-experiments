    Adds a new class, :class:`.BackendData` which provides a common access inferface
    for both :class:`.BackendV1` and :class:`.BackendV2` data fields, since those
    classes do not share the same interface. The :class:`.BackendData` can be called
    on a backend and used immediately, and it is also automatically stored as the
    `_backend_data` field of :class:`Experiment`. Note that not all data fields
    are currently accessible via :class:`.BackendData`; to access additional
    fields, the corresponding method should be added to :class:`.BackendData`
    with correct treatment for both V1 and V2 backends.
