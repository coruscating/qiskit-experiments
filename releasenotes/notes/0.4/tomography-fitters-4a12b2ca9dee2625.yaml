    The ``scipy_linear_lstsq`` and ``scipy_gaussian_lstsq`` fitters for the
    :class:`.StateTomographyAnalysis` and :class:`.ProcessTomographyAnalysis`
    classes have been deprecated.

    The unweighted, unconstrained least-squares fitting performed by
    ``scipy_linear_lstsq`` is equivalent to the :func:`.linear_inversion`
    fitter, but with worse performance and memory usage.

    For weighted least-squares fitting the CVXPY fitters
    :func:`.cvxpy_linear_lstsq` or :func:`.cvxpy_gaussian_lstsq`, which also
    support support PSD and CPTP constraints, should be used instead.
