    The handling of communication with the database has been transferred to the
    new `qiskit-ibm-experiment <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibm-experiment>`_ 
    package and does not rely on the soon to be deprecated 
    `qiskit-ibmq-provider <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-ibmq-provider>`_ package. 
    In addition, The :class:`.ExperimentData` and
    :class:`.DbExperimentData` classes were merged, and the inner handling of experiment
    data was somewhat simplified. This should not have any effect on the current
    codebase and its usage of :class:`.ExperimentData`.
