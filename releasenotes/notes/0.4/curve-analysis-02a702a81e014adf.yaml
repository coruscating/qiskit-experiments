    The :class:`.CurveAnalysis` has been modified to delegate the core fitting functionality to the
    `LMFIT <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/>`_ package. Fit curves are specified using
    `LMFIT Model <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/model.html#>`_ objects. For multi-curve fitting
    a list of models can be used.

    A new analysis option ``fit_method`` has been added to allow a user to select the fitting 
    algorithm used by the LMFIT `minimizer <https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/fitting.html>`_.
    The default fit method is ``"least_squares"``.
    Analysis class author can flexibly define new analysis instance
    with LMFIT ``Model`` objects. See LMFIT documentation for user guide.

    New curve analysis baseclass :class:`.CompositeCurveAnalysis` has been added.
    This curve analysis variant offers a framework to fit experiment outcomes
    with different independent fit models. 
    For example, if you define an experiment scanning a parameter with different conditions, 
    e.g. with different control qubit states in some two-qubit gate experiment, 
    the composite curve analysis can implement the experiment with simpler code 
    compared with writing a conventional batch experment.
    See class documentation for more details.
  - |
    New options ``filter_data`` has been added to :class:`.CurveAnalysis` and its subclass.
    This dictionary provides a set of required metadata so that the analysis can filter
    experiment results input to the fitter. Curve analysis checks experiment result
    metadata, originating in the experiment circuit metadata, and the measure outcomes with
    matched metadata are only used for the fitting.
  - |
    New options have been added to the :class:`.CurveAnalysis` curve drawer.
    
  - |
    The ``figure_title`` option has been added. This allows user to show an arbitrary string 
    in the output figure title. See the example code below to learn how to set the option.
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
      exp = MyExperiment(...)
      exp.analysis.drawer.set_options(figure_title="Qubit0")

  - |
    ``plot_options`` has been added. This was conventionally included
    in the :class:`SeriesDef` dataclass, which was static and not configurable. 
    Now end-user can update visual representation of curves through this option.
    This option is a dictionary that defines three properties, for example,
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
      exp = MyExperiment(...)
      exp.analysis.drawer.set_options(
        plot_options={
          "curve1": {"color": "r", "symbol": "o", "canvas": 0},
          "curve2": {"color": "b", "symbol": "x", "canvas": 1},
        }
      )  
    
    The dictionary is keyed on the curve name that should match with the ``name`` property
    of the LMFIT models provided to the curve analysis. ``color`` and ``symbol`` are the
    color and marker of the curves and the scatter plots, respectively. 
    ``canvas`` specifies the sub-axis index, which is available when multi-axis plot is enabled.

upgrade:
  - |
    A new result class :class:`.CurveFitResult` is introduced. 
    This class stores a richer context of curve fitting overview with several extra statistics.
    This is the minimum attributes of the LMFIT ``MinimizerResult`` with some extention.
    Fit parameters in UFloat representation are also stored while keeping
    the correlation information, which is accessible with the ``.ufloat_params`` property.
    Note that the value of the first analysis result entry titled with ``@Parameters_*`` 
    has been replaced with this data format. This entry had been just a list of fit values 
    in Python float format with covariance matrix separately stored in ``.extra`` metadata.
    Comparing with the conventional data, new class :class:`.CurveFitResult` provides users with 
    a better understanding of the analysis outcome. New object has prettyprint mechanism.
  - |
    The :class:`~.library.characterization.RoughDrag` characterization experiment has been upgraded with more flexibility.
    This experiment combines multiple DRAG parameter scans (curves) for different unit sequence
    reptitions. Conventionally this number is limited to three curves, however, now we can define
    more than three curves. The corresponding fit model is dynamically generated
    based on new fit option ``reps`` in the associated analysis :class:`~.library.characterization.DragCalAnalysis`.
    This may sometimes provide better accuracy for estimating the DRAG ``beta`` parameter.
  - |
    The implementations of several methods in :class:`.BaseCurveAnalysis` have been moved to
    its subclass :class:`.CurveAnalysis`. :meth:`.BaseCurveAnalysis._run_data_processing`,
    :meth:`.BaseCurveAnalysis._format_data`, and :meth:`.BaseCurveAnalysis._run_curve_fit`
    have been turned into abstract methods, and :meth:`.BaseCurveAnalysis._generate_fit_guesses`
    has been moved to :class:`CurveAnalysis`. There is no net upgrade on the behavior of
    curve analysis subclasses, since :class:`.BaseCurveAnalysis` is an abstract class.
deprecations:
  - |
    Multiple methods, classes and functions in curve analysis have been deprecated and
    replaced with using functionality of the LMFIT library. These include:

    * Curve fit solver :func:`.curve_fit` and :func:`.multi_curve_fit`
    * Dataclass of the curve fit result :func:`.FitData`
    * Some fit functions dedicated to a particular curve analysis in the module
      :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.fit_function`.
      Now curve analysis author can define arbitrary fit functions callable or string
      with LMFIT models, not limited to functions in this module.

fixes:
  - |
    The ``.init_params`` value of the :class:`.CurveFitResult` has been fixed.
    This value was copied from the LMFIT ``MinimizerResult.init_values``,
    however this is not the initial parameters set to the solver.
    Now correct initial parameters are set to :attr:`.CurveFitResult.init_params`.
