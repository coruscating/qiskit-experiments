    Adds a :class:`.FigureData` class for adding metadata to analysis result figures. Figures added to
    :class:`.ExperimentData` are now stored using this class. The raw image object (SVG or matplotlib.Figure)
    can be accessed using the :attr:`.FigureData.figure` attribute.

    Note that currently metadata is only stored locally and will be discarded when saved to the cloud
    experiment service database.
