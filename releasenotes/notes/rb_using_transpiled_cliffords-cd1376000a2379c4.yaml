   Improved the performance of circuit generation in 1Q/2Q RB experiments (about 10x speedup).
   That is mainly achieved by the following two updates in their implementation:
   - Custom transpilation of circuits (mapping circuits to physical qubits without using transpile),
   - Integer-based Clifford operations (especially sparse lookup table with triplet decomposition
   for 2Q Clifford circuits).
