features:
  - |
    Added pulse simulator backends `PulseBackend` and subclass `SingleTransmonTestBackend`
    that used Qiskit Dynamics to simulate pulse schedules that are included in 
    the calibrations attached to transpiled quantum circuits. The backend is capable of 
    simulating level-one (IQ data) and level-two (counts) data. The main purpose of this 
    backend is the make the test suite more realistic and allow for tutorials that 
    do not need hardware backends.
issues:
  - |
    The backend only suports single qubit operations and will be upgraded in the future.
upgrade:
  - |
    The `SingleTransmonTestBackend` is now used for the test_rough_amplitude, 
    test_rough_frequency and test_rabi.
deprecations:
  - |
    `qiskit_experiments.test.mock_iq_helpers.MockIQRabiHelper` is now deprecated.
