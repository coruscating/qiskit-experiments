features:
  - |
    A new method :meth:`.qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations.has_template`
    has been added to :class:`.qiskit_experiments.calibration_management.Calibrations`
    to check if a template schedule exists for a particular set of qubits.
fixes:
  - |
    :class:`.qiskit_experiments.library.FineXDragCal` and 
    :class:`.qiskit_experiments.library.EFRoughXSXAmplitudeCal` were updated to
    attach `"sx"` and `"x"` calibrations to their circuits, respectively.
    Previously, they only attached the `"x"` and `"x12"` calibrations that they
    were calibrating. See issue `#1158 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments/issues/1158>`_.
