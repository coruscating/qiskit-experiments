    Several deprecated methods and options have been removed and will no longer work:

    * ``BaseExperiment.analysis_options`` has been removed. ``experiment.analysis.options``
      should be used instead.
    * The ``__analysis_class__`` attribute of :class:`.BaseAnalysis` has been removed.
      Use the ``analysis`` kwarg of ``BaseExperiment.__init__`` to specify a default 
      analysis class."
    * The ``component_experiment_data()`` method has been removed from 
      :class:`.ExperimentData` and replaced by :meth:`.ExperimentData.child_data`.
    * The ``CompositeExperiment.component_analysis`` method has been removed. Component 
      analysis classes should be directly accessed using 
      :meth:`.CompositeAnalysis.component_analysis`.
    * The ``library`` argument to :class:`.Calibrations` has been removed and replaced by 
      ``libraries``.
    * The class attribute ``CurveAnalysis.__fixed_parameters__`` has been removed.
      The ``fixed_parameters`` analysis option should be set instead.
    * The method ``CurveAnalysis._data()`` has been removed.
    * The :class:`.CurveAnalysis` attribute ``__series__`` has been removed and is 
      replaced by the constructor argument.
    * The ``FineDragAnalysis``, ``FineFrequencyAnalysis``, and ``FineHalfAngleAnalysis``
      analysis classes have been removed and replaced by 
      :class:`.ErrorAmplificationAnalysis`.
    * Randomized benchmarking utility functions ``get_error_dict_from_backend()``, 
      ``count_ops()``, ``gates_per_clifford()``, ``calculate_1q_epg()``, and 
      ``calculate_2q_epg()`` have been removed from :class:`.RBUtils` and replaced by 
      methods in the RB experiment and analysis themselves. 
    * The ``error_dict`` analysis option of :class:`.RBAnalysis` has been removed and 
      merged into the analysis option ``gate_error_ratio``.
