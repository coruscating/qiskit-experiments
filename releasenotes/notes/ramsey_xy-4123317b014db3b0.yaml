    The algorithm to estimate fit parameter guesses in :class:`.RamseyXYAnalysis`
    has been upgraded. 
    Conventional algorithm was not robust to experiment outcome with low frequency,
    where Ramsey X and Y curve almost stay at P=1.0 and 0.5, respectively.
    New algorithm offers reliable initial guesses also for such situation.
    In addition, number of frequency guesses has been increased to cover uncertainty of FFT.
