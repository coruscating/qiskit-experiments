features:
  - |
    A new mixin class :mod:`~qiskit_experiments.framework.RestlessMixin` is added
    that enables experiments to run in restless measurement mode, where the qubits 
    are not reset after each measurement.
  - |
    A new data processing node to marginalize qubit counts is introduced. This
    node is, for instance, used in the data processing of a fine ZX amplitude
    experiment run with restless measurements.
fixes:
  - |
    The FineZXAmplitude now works properly with restless measurements.
