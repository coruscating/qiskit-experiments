    The ResonanceAnalysis class has been switched from a Gaussian fit to a Lorentzian
    fit function. Furthermore, the Gaussian fitting capability is preserved by moving
    the Gaussian fitting to a new class called GaussianAnalysis. Note that the
    previous analysis can be used by doing:

    .. code:: python

      spec = ResonatorSpectroscopy(qubit, backend)
      spec.analysis = GaussianAnalysis()

    where :code:`GaussianAnalysis` is imported from ``curve_analysis``.

    Added a new experiment
    :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.library.ResonatorSpectroscopy` to run spectroscopy
    on readout resonators. This is done by attaching a custom pulse-schedule to
    the measure instruction. Note that the resonator spectroscopy experiment may
    cause errors on backends that do not support circuit instructions with measurement
    schedules attached to them.

    A new data processing node
    :py:class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.nodes.ToAbs` is introduced to
    take the absolute value of IQ points. This node is needed to analyse readout
    resonator spectroscopy IQ data since it rotates around in the IQ plane but can
    also be used in other contexts.
