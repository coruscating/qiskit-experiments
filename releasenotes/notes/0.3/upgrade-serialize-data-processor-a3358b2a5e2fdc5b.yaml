    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.data_processor.DataProcessor`
    and :class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.data_action.DataAction` are
    now JSON serializable with the qiskit experiments default encoder.
    This allows one to retrieve a configured processor from the record and
    re-analyze loaded data with the processor. Trained nodes are serialized with
    accquired parameters so that the loaded processor can continue to process new data.

    Data handling of training parameters in
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.data_action.TrainableDataAction`
    has been upgraded for the JSON serialization.
    Updated class implements :meth:`_default_parameters`, :meth:`set_parameters`, and
    :meth:`parameters` methods, where the training parameters are managed with :class:`Options`
    instance. A node developer must implement :meth:`_default_parameters` class method
    to automatically populate the JSON configuration dictionary.
fixes:
  - |
    Poor python instance representation of
    :class:`~qiskit_experiments.data_processing.data_action.DataAction`
    has been upgraded to show all information contained in the class instance.
