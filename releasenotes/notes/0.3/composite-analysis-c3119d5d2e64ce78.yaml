features:
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.CompositeAnalysis.component_analysis` method for accessing
    a component analysis class object from a composite analysis object.
upgrade:
  - |
    :class:`.CompositeAnalysis` initialization is changed to require a list of
    :class:`.BaseAnalysis` objects so that these are stored in the class, rather
    than being accessed later via a composite experiment. This initialization is
    handled automatically by :class:`.ParallelExperiment` and
    :class:`.BatchExperiment` composite experiments.
deprecations:
  - |
    The :meth:`.CompositeExperiment.component_analysis` method has been
    deprecated. Component analysis classes should now be directly accessed
    from a :meth:`.CompositeAnalysis` object using the
    :meth:.`CompositeAnalysis.component_analysis` method.
