    The :class:`.ParallelExperiment` and :class:`.BatchExperiment` composite experiments
    have been changed to no longer return analysis results containing information about
    sub-experiments. Instead, use the :meth:`~.ParallelExperiment.child_data` method to
    retrieve sub-experiments of a given composite experiment.
