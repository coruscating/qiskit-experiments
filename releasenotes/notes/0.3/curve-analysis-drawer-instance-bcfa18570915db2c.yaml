    :class:`MplCurveDrawer` has been added for curve analysis visualization.
    This class instance is JSON serializable with the experiment encoder and 
    it implements public methods to draw analysis results in several different formats.
    Its instance is attached to :class:`CurveAnalysis` instance as an analysis options ``curve_plotter``.
    This class is a drop-in replacement of :class:`MplDrawSingleCanvas` and :class:`MplDrawMultiCanvasVstack`.
    This instance has dedicated drawing options.
    New option ``subplots``, which is a tuple of two integer representing ``(n_rows, n_cols)``,
    defines arbitrary 2D array subplots without using :class:`MplDrawMultiCanvasVstack`.

    Drawing options are moved from :attr:`CurveAnalysis.options` to :attr:`MplCurveDrawer.options`.
deprecations:
  - |
    Conventional curve visualization classes :class:`MplDrawSingleCanvas`,
    :class:`MplDrawMultiCanvasVstack` and the stylesheet :class:`PlotterStyle` have been deprecated
    and now replaced with :class:`MplCurveDrawer`.
    These classes had been attached to the analysis instance as a ``curve_plotter`` which is a string 
    and mapped to the class method ``.draw`` at runtime via :FitResultPlotters: Enum.
    It was almost impossible to track the code and hurted the readability.
    In addition, this implementation was problematic due to dependency on the
    raw data points saved in an instance variable. See qiskit-experiments/#737 for details.
