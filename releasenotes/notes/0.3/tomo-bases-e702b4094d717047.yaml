features:
  - |
    Added new tomography basis classes :class:`.LocalPreparationBasis` and 
    :class:`.LocalMeasurementBasis` for constructing N-qubit bases from the
    tensor product of 1-qubit instructions. These classes can optionally be
    initialized with custom qubit-specific density matrix or POVM element
    states for respectively for tomographic reconstruction.
upgrade:
  - |
    The tomography experiment basis classes :class:`.PauliMeasurementBasis`,
    :class:`.PauliPreparationBasis`, and :class:`.Pauli6PreparationBasis` have
    been upgraded to be instances of the new tomography bases classes
    :class:`.LocalMeasurementBasis` and :class:`.LocalPreparationBasis`.
  - |
    Changed the signature of the :meth:`~.MeasurementBasis.circuit` and
    :meth:`~.MeasurementBasis.matrix` methods of tomography basis classes
    to require a ``qubits`` kwarg for specifying the specific physical qubits
    that the basis is being applied to.
developer:
  - |
    Streamlined the tomography experiment basis base classes into two
    abstract base classes :class:`.PreparationBasis` and
    :class:`.MeasurementBasis`.
