    Default fit bounds for ``d_theta`` parameter of
    :py:class:`qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.ErrorAmplificationAnalysis`
    class has been updated from [-pi, pi] to [-0.8 pi, 0.8 pi].
    This change will improve the bad fit when the error value is really close to zero.
    This has sometimes yielded in ``d_theta`` ~ pi rather than zero.
    Though 0.8 is the empirical factor, this is okey for most situations since
    the amplification analysis is applied to experiments in the small error regime
    (this is often sufficiently smaller than pi).
