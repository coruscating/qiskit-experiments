upgrade:
  - |
    New default :class:`CurveAnalysis` analysis option ``fixed_parameters``
    has been added. We can directly exclude parameters from the fit model
    of the particular analysis instance, rather than defining a new class to define
    the class attribute :attr:`CurveAnalysis.__fixed_parameters__`.
deprecations:
  - |
    Class attribute :attr:`CurveAnalysis.__fixed_parameters__` has been deprecated
    and support for the instantiation of the class with this attribute will be dropped soon.
    In addition, the fixed parameter value defined as a standalone analysis option
    has been deprecated. Please set `fixed_parameters` option instead.
    This is a python dictionary of fixed parameter values keyed on the fit parameter names.
  - |
    Analysis class :class:`FineDragAnalysis` has been deprecated. Now you can directly
    set fixed parameters to the :class:`ErrorAmplificationAnalysis` instance as an analysis option.
  - |
    Analysis class :class:`FineFrequencyAnalysis` has been deprecated. Now you can directly
    set fixed parameters to the :class:`ErrorAmplificationAnalysis` instance as an analysis option.
  - |
    Analysis class :class:`FineHalfAngleAnalysis` has been deprecated. Now you can directly
    set fixed parameters to the :class:`ErrorAmplificationAnalysis` instance as an analysis option.
