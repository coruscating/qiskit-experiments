    Adds a :meth:`.BaseExperiment._finalize` method to :class:`.BaseExperiment`
    which is after configuring any runtime options, backend, or analysis
    classes but before generation and execution of experiment
    circuits during :class:`.BaseExperiment.run`.

    This method is intended to be overridden in experiment subclasses if they
    need to configure any analysis or runtime options based on a combination
    of properties of the experiment, for example some combination of backend,
    experiment and run options.
