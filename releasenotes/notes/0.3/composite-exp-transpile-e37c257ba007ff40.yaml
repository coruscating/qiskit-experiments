upgrade:
  - |
    The component experiment circuits of :class:`.ParallelExperiment` and
    :class:`.BatchExperiment` are now explicitly transpiled using the
    respective component experiments
    :meth:`~.BaseExperiment.transpile_options` before being combined into
    the composite circuits returned by the :class:`.BaseExperiment.circuits`
    method. 

    Any transpile options set directly on the :class:`.ParallelExperiment`
    or :class:`.BatchExperiment` will also be applied as a transpile option
    to each component experiment.
  - |
    The circuits returned by the :meth:`.ParallelExperiment.circuits` method
    of parallel circuits will now always be the combined circuits circuits
    of the transpiled circuits of the individual component experiments
    transpiled with that experiments transpile options.
