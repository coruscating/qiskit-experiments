upgrade:
  - |
    The ``job_metadata`` field has been removed from
    :class:`.BaseExperiment`. Experiments which needed job metadata for
    analysis should now directly override the ``.BaseExperiment._metadata``
    method to store the required job metadata. 
    
    Individual experiments using :class:`.CurveAnalysis` based analysis
    have been updated to store the ``meas_level`` and ``meas_return``
    run options in metadata if they have been set in the experiment for
    use in setting the data processor during analysis.
  - |
    The ``BaseExperiment._additional_metadata`` method has been removed, and
    experiments should now directly override the ``BaseExperiment._metadata``
    method to add additional experiment metadata to the run experiment data.
