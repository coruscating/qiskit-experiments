features:
  - |
    Improved handling of job and analysis processes in :meth:`.ExperimentData`.
    Verbose logging information on execution of analysis callbacks in an
    experiment can enabled by setting the ``qiskit_experiments`` log level
    to ``DEBUG``.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.jobs` method for returning a list of
    Qiskit Jobs for a running or finished experiment.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.job_status` method for returning the status
    of Qiskit Job execution for an experiment. This returns a
    :class:`.JobStatus` enum class value.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.analysis_status` method for returning the status
    of analysis callbacks for an experiment. This returns a
    :class:`.AnalysisStatus` enum class value.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.cancel_analysis` method to allow cancelling
    pending analysis callbacks. Note that analysis callbacks that have already
    started running cannot be cancelled.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.cancel` to cancel both jobs and analysis.
  - |
    Adds :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_jobs` method for adding one or more Qiskit
    jobs to experiment data. This method takes an optional ``timeout`` kwarg that
    when used will automatically cancel all non-finished jobs that exceed the
    alloted time.
  - |
    Added enum classes for experiment, job, and analysis status.
upgrade:
  - |
    The value returned by :meth:`.ExperimentData.status` has been changed from
    a string to a :class:`.ExperimentStatus` enum class value.
deprecations:
  - |
    Adding data from jobs using :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_data` has been
    deprecated. This method should now only be used to add data from Qiskit
    :class:`.Result` objects or raw data dicts.
    Job data should now be added using the new :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_jobs`
    method instead.
  - |
    The ``timeout`` kwarg of :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_data` has been deprecated.
    Timeout for adding jobs is now handled by the :meth:`.ExperimentData.add_jobs`
    method.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes an issue with :meth:`.ExperimentData.block_for_results` sometimes
    having a race issue with all analysis callbacks finishing.
