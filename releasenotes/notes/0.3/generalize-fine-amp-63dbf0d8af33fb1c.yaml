features:
  - |
    A new fine amplitude experiment for two qubits is added. This experiment
    accepts a two-qubit gate with on rotation angle as parameter.
upgrade:
  - |
    The FineAmplitude experiment is refactored for more flexibility. Furthermore,
    the FineAmplitudeAnalysis class is upgraded to accept 0/1 calibration
    circuits to better fit the amplitude A of the ping-pong pattern.
