    The :class:`qiskit_experiments.data_processing.Probability`
    data processing node has been enhanced to compute the estimated mean and
    standard deviation of a measured outcome probability using a Bayesian update
    of a a Beta distribution prior from the observed measurement outcomes.
    The default prior is an uninformative prior. The user can also provide a custom
    prior for the probability distribution.
fixes:
  - |
    The :class:`qiskit_experiments.data_processing.Probability` data processing
    node will no longer return exactly 0 or 1 for a probability estimate. This
    fixes an issue where this could cause division by 0 when computing weights
    during curve fitting analysis.
upgrade:
  - |
    Data format used in the :class:`qiskit_experiments.data_processing.DataProcessor`
    has been changed from `Tuple[Any, Any]` to `np.ndarray`.
  - |
    Uncertainty propagation in the
    :class:`qiskit_experiments.data_processing.DataProcessor` class is now
    computed using the `uncertainties <https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/>`_
    package.
    See :mod:`qiskit_experiments.data_processing` module documentation for details.
