    The handling of communication with the database has been transferred to the
    new `qiskit-ibm-experiment` package and does not rely on the soon to be
    deprecated `qiskit-ibmq` package. In addition, The `ExperimentData` and
    `DbExprimentData` classes were merged, and the inner handling of experiment
    data was somewhat simplified. This should not have any effect on the current
    codebase and its usage of `ExperimentData`.
