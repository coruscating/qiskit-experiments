    Added new visualization module to plot figures and draw onto figure canvases. The new module contains
    plotters and drawers, which integrate with CurveAnalysis but can be used independently of the
    analysis classes. This module replaces the old and now deprecated
    `qiskit_experiments.curve_analysis.visualization` submodule.
