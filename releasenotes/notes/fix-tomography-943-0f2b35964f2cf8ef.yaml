    Fixes bug in :class:`~.StateTomography` and :class:`~.ProcessTomography`
    experiments where if the input circuit contained conditional instructions
    with multiple classical registers the tomography measurement circuits
    would contain incorrect conditionals due to a bug in the
    :meth:`.QuantumCircuit.compose` method.

    See Issue #942 <https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-experiments/issues/943>`_
    for additional details.
