    # section: overview
        Interleaved Randomized Benchmarking (RB) is a method
        to estimate the average error-rate of a certain quantum gate.

        An interleaved RB experiment generates a standard RB sequences of random Cliffords
        and another sequence with the interleaved given gate.
        After running the two sequences on a backend, it calculates the probabilities to get back to
        the ground state, fits the two exponentially decaying curves, and estimates
        the interleaved gate error. See Ref. [1] for details.
